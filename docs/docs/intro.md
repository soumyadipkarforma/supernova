# Introduction

**Supernova** is a mobile development environment reimagined for Android. It allows you to write, run, and manage code directly on your device with a professional-grade experience.

## Features

- **Project Workspace**: Manage files and folders with a full-featured file explorer.
- **Code Editor**: Syntax highlighting for multiple languages (Kotlin, Python, JS, etc.).
- **Terminal**: Integrated terminal emulator (powered by Termux) for full shell access.
- **Local Browser**: Preview HTML/JS projects instantly.
- **Git Integration**: Version control right from your phone.

## Getting Started

Supernova is designed to be intuitive. Upon launching the app, you will be greeted with the **Workspace** view.

1.  **Grant Permissions**: Supernova requires storage access to create and manage your workspace.
2.  **Install Termux**: For the terminal to function, the Termux app must be installed on your device. Supernova will guide you if it's missing.
3.  **Start Coding**: Create a new file or folder using the floating action button.

## Architecture

Supernova is built using:
-   **Kotlin & Jetpack Compose**: For a modern, native Android UI.
-   **Termux Libraries**: For robust terminal emulation and package management.
-   **Android Storage Access Framework**: For secure file management.
