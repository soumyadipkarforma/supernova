Welcome to the official Supernova development blog!

Supernova is a professional-grade development environment for Android, reimagined to be powerful yet accessible.

## Contributing to Docs

We've made it easy to add new pages or blog posts.

### Adding a Blog Post
1. Go to the `docs/blog` folder in the repository.
2. Create a new markdown file (e.g., `2024-01-01-my-post.md`).
3. Add the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   slug: my-post
   title: My New Post
   authors: [your-name]
   tags: [update]
   ---
   ```
4. Write your content!

### Adding a Doc Page
1. Go to the `docs/docs` folder.
2. Create a new markdown file.
3. It will automatically appear in the sidebar (or you can configure `sidebar_position` in the frontmatter).

Happy coding!
