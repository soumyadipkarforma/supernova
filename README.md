# Supernova: Mobile Coding environment

Supernova is an open-source Android IDE designed for students and developers who don't have access to a traditional PC. It provides a native UI for file management, code editing, and web testing, while offloading all execution to the powerful **Termux** environment.

- **Project Execution**: Run scripts directly from the editor into a Termux terminal window.
